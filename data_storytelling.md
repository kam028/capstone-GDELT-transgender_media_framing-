# GitHub Data Storytelling

This page documents the data storytelling component of my capstone project,
**Who Tells the Transgender Story?**, with a focus on how quantitative findings
are translated into accessible narratives for non-technical audiences.

---

## Intended Audience
The primary audience for this project includes:
- Advocacy organizations
- Journalists and newsroom leaders
- Policymakers
- Members of the public seeking to understand media patterns

The dashboard is designed so users do not need statistical training to identify
key trends in media framing.

## Storytelling Strategy
Rather than presenting results as tables of coefficients or test statistics,
the project uses visual storytelling to guide users through three core questions:

1. **How often do transgender-related stories appear in the news?**
2. **When coverage appears, how is it framed (negative, neutral, positive)?**
3. **Where and around which topics does negative framing concentrate?**

Each section of the dashboard builds on the previous one, moving from broad
patterns to more specific explanations.

## Use of Visual Elements
Key visual choices include:
- **Time-series charts** to highlight spikes around major policy and cultural events
- **Geographic maps** to show how coverage spreads beyond the U.S.
- **Bar charts and ranked lists** to compare themes associated with different tones
- **Interactive filters** that allow users to explore patterns without being
  overwhelmed by technical detail

Tooltips are written in plain language and avoid statistical jargon whenever possible.

## Narrative Goal
The goal of the storytelling approach is to ensure that users come away with a
clear understanding that negative media coverage of transgender people is
patterned and concentrated, not random.

By allowing users to explore the data themselves, the dashboard encourages
reflection and accountability rather than prescribing a single interpretation.
