# GitHub Link Computational Social Justice

This page situates my capstone project,
**Who Tells the Transgender Story?**, within a computational social justice framework.

## Why This Is a Social Justice Issue
For many people, news media is the primary source of information about transgender
lives. When coverage consistently frames transgender people as controversies,
threats, or problems to manage, those narratives shape public opinion, policy
decisions, and everyday safety.

This makes media framing itself a site of social harm.

## Role of Computational Methods
Computational tools make it possible to move beyond anecdotal claims about bias
and instead identify patterns at scale.

In this project, statistical testing and machine learning are used to:
- Identify which themes are most strongly associated with negative framing
- Show that hostile coverage is concentrated in specific topics and outlets
- Demonstrate that negative tone is not evenly distributed or random

The goal is not prediction, but **visibility and accountability**.

## Ethical Considerations
Several ethical issues guided this work:
- Avoiding overclaiming causality where only association is measured
- Presenting findings in ways that do not further stigmatize trans communities
- Designing visualizations that emphasize structural patterns rather than
  individual blame

Data limitations and uncertainty are acknowledged throughout the analysis.

## Intended Use and Impact
This project is intended to support:
- Advocacy groups monitoring media coverage
- Journalists reflecting on editorial practices
- Researchers studying media, policy, and social harm

By making patterns in coverage visible, the project contributes to conversations
about how media systems can better represent transgender people as full
participants in public life, not recurring controversies.
